# mpv_clock

Shows the OS clock in the mpv OSD. By default the keybindings are `c` for showing the clock for 5 seconds, and `C` for toggling the clock on indefinitely. These are configurable in the lua file.

To use, simply place the `.lua` file in `%appdata%/mpv/scripts` on Windows or `~/.config/mpv/scripts` on Unix.
